## Example Scenario

1. 

```bash
sudo mn --switch ovs,protocols=OpenFlow14 --controller remote,ip=localhost
```

2. Introduce Misconfiguration in Backup Path via MCP

```bash
./scripts/install_bad_rule.sh
```

3. Disable the Primary Path Link

```bash
mininet> h1 ping h2
```

Expected: Pings fail due to the misconfigured backup path.

4. Ask MCP to find the issue

# Network Summary
- Devices: 1
- Links: 0
- Hosts: 2
- Clusters: 1

## Device Details
- of:0000000000000001: Available, Manufacturer: Nicira, Inc., HW: Open vSwitch, SW: 2.13.8
```

---

**Step 8: Identify the Issues**

**Assistant:**  
>Based on the information gathered, I've identified two issues that could be preventing the ping between h1 and h2:

1. **Incorrect Flow Rule Configuration:**  
   A flow rule with priority **50000** directs all IPv4 traffic (0x800) to port 1 only, regardless of destination. This rule prevents traffic destined for h2 (on port 2) from being correctly forwarded.

2. **Reactive Forwarding Not Working as Expected:**  
   While there is a lower priority rule (priority **5**) that sends packets to the controller for reactive forwarding, the higher priority rule (priority **50000**) takes precedence and bypasses the reactive forwarding mechanism.

---

**Step 9: Implement the Solution**

**Assistant:**  
>Let's remove the problematic flow rule that's directing all IPv4 traffic to port 1.

*Command:*  
```
View result from remove_flow_rule from onos (local)
{
  `flowId`: `50665496257835825`,
  `deviceId`: `of:0000000000000001`
}
```

*Output:*  
```
Flow 50665496257835825 removed successfully from device of:0000000000000001
```

---

**Step 10: Verify the Updated Flow Rules**

**Assistant:**  
>Now, let's verify the flows to ensure the rule was removed.

*Command:*  
```
View result from get_device_flows from onos (local)
```

*Output (abridged):*  
```
{'flows': [
  {'groupId': 0, 'priority': 40000, 'id': '281478909873038', 'selector': {'criteria': [{'type': 'ETH_TYPE', 'ethType': '0x806'}]}},
  {'groupId': 0, 'priority': 5, 'id': '281475012051420', 'selector': {'criteria': [{'type': 'ETH_TYPE', 'ethType': '0x800'}]}},
  // ... additional flows, with the problematic rule removed ...
]}
```

---

**Final Summary:**

**Assistant:**  
>The problematic flow rule has now been removed. With this change, the network should operate with the correct reactive forwarding behavior:
  
- **IPv4 Traffic:** The lower priority rule (priority 5) will now send IPv4 traffic (0x800) to the controller, allowing the reactive forwarding application to dynamically install the appropriate flows.
- **ARP Traffic:** The rule with priority 40000 continues to send ARP traffic (0x806) to the controller.
- **Communication:** When h1 pings h2, the packets will be handled by the controller and forwarded correctly, enabling communication between the hosts.

>If issues persist, consider these additional steps:
> - Verify that the reactive forwarding application is active.
> - Check for any firewall rules or other applications that might be interfering with traffic.
> - Confirm that both hosts are configured with the correct IP addresses and subnet masks.
